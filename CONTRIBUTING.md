# Contributing

## Version Control Workflow (Git)

### Branching model:

*   `main` -> production-ready
*   `develop` -> integration branch
*   `feature/*` -> per feature
*   `hotfix/*` -> urgent fixes

### Pull request rules:

*   PRs required before merge to `main`/`develop`
*   Enforce code reviews (at least 1 reviewer).

### Commit convention (optional):

*   Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add stock movement API`).
